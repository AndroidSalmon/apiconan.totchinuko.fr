# F.A.Q
## 1. Do you support single player ?
No.

## 2. Do you support Pippi ?
No. I have my reasons.

## 3. How do I open Sudo Admin Panel ?
First, this is not Sudo Discord. Yes I'm participating in the project, but I'm not the actual developer. By default, shortcut is `Shift + U`. If it doesn't work in a fresh install, refere to 1. If you are not in single player, try `DataCMD ClientConfig` in the game console to open a panel that contain the keybinds for Sudo. Alternatively, Admin panel can be opened with the Console Command `DataCMD SudoExile`

## 4. How do I open Sudo Client Config ?
`Shift + Alt + U` by default, on Tot ! Chat using the cog or in the console `DataCMD ClientConfig`. 

## 5. What is the load order of X, Y or Z ?
Sudo Exile always go first, then my mods, in no particular order. Custom goes all the way down in the list.

## 6. Please explain Sudo ?
Sudo Exile is a framework, by itself it does not do much. It is a mod made for other mod to have some common ground to communicate and fit all of their UI in a cohesive UI panel. I am not the developer of Sudo, but I do work actively with him. If you have issues in regard to roles, permission, Super Admin mode, Logs, please go to the Sudo Exile Discord where you can get help for those features.

## 7. Thespian and scripting when ?
No ETA for those. 

## 8. Infinit modlist reboot, mods acting up
Their is an issue with the ModControllerCache of the game. Thoses issues can often be resolved by removing the following file either from the player side having issues, or from the server side if every player have issues. It is hard to explain, but you'll find the file here:
`Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Saved\ModControllerCache.json`
Just delete it and see if everything is back in order.

## 9. I have a problem with Sudo and/or Roleplay Redux
Then go ask on those mods discord, please. I'm not the developer of those mods. 

## 10. I can't open the chat window when pushing Enter when Pippi is installed
Check this [page](tips) for a solution.

## 11. I moved the chat beyond the border of my screen, how do I move it back ?
Open the Sudo Client config (FAQ 4), then in the chat settings, you should find buttons to move and reset the chat position.

## 12. Can I import IQOL saves into Custom ? Can I apply an IQOL save on my character and then save it with Custom ?
No to both questions. Their is no way, how ever convuluted that could be, to do that. Trust me, I'm an engineer.
