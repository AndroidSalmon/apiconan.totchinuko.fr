> ### Small correction
> In the video, when I start scaling the sword in the back, I reference that doing so might be cheating, that the weapon in the hands will have the same size. When I say the same size, I meant to say the normal size, the unscaled version of the sword. Whatever size it will have in your back, wont affect the weapon in your hands.
