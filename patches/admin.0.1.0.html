                        <p>I know it is not funny to wipe some of your data, and believe me I have better things to do than spending multiple days moving my code around and making you start over again. The reason is simple. I became aware of an Unreal Engine bug that did not yet appear on my mod. This bug might have triggered critical crash when trying to load the mod at all, and I did not want to risk getting into that situation at all. So I moved my code to avoid the potential issue all together. Wiping the data should not be needed anymore in the futur, but sometimes, shit happen.</p>
