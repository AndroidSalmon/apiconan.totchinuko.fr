                        <li>Post process offset sliders did not have the proper bounds and default values</li>
                        <li>Kits did not give the proper amount of attributes and knowledge points</li>
                        <li><span class="version">0.2.1</span> Missing permission check when using the puppet placer</li>
                        <li><span class="version">0.2.1</span> Invisible command was conflicting with various other mods</li>
