## API
`1.3.0`
- Added 2 Datatables dedicated to material recognition for hair and skin. If you make a hair mod or body mod that have a custom material, but you'd like to use the one from Custom while it is installed, you can inject to the table a reference to your custom base material in order for Custom to recognize it as hair or skin and replace it.
- Changed the Tot_I_Customization interface to reflect the changes of the hiding conditions.

## New
`1.3.0`
- New Accessory hiding Conditions. Your old hiding conditions have been reset in concequence.
